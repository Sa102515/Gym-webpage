      <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Strength training (also known as resistance training) is a type of exercise that causes your muscles to contract against an outside resistance. The outside resistance can be from your body weight, weight machines, medicine balls, resistance bands or dumbbells. <br> <br>Why strength training is important?
        Strength training can help you manage or lose weight, and it can increase your metabolism to help you burn more calories. Enhance your quality of life. Strength training may enhance your quality of life and improve your ability to do everyday activities. Strength training can also protect your joints from injury.

        </h2>
        <p>Building strength doesn’t just help you in your workouts—it can make day-to-day life easier too. 

          “Resistance training, whether it’s moving your body weight or external weights, is a great way to help your body stay functional and healthy in the long run,” Sivan Fagan, an ACE-certified personal trainer and owner of Strong With Sivan in Baltimore, tells SELF.
          
          Increasing muscle strength can help make everyday movements less of a struggle, whether you're carrying a week’s worth of groceries up the stairs, placing a bulky object on an overhead shelf, or simply getting up off the floor. And building balanced strength—by making sure you’re focusing on all muscle groups—is important because it helps prevent weaker muscles from overcompensating, which can lead to injury.</p>

          <p>
            Squats burn calories and might help you lose weight. They also lower your chances of injuring your knees and ankles. As you exercise, the movement strengthens your tendons, bones, and ligaments around the leg muscles. It takes some of the weight off your knees and ankles.</p>

Unlock your hips and slowly move your hips backward until the bar lowers past your knees, then bend your knees and slowly lower the bar to set it down make sure you unlock them at the same time.</p>
